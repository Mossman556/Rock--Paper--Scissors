# Rock--Paper--Scissors

This script is a simple implementation of the game "Rock-Paper-Scissors". 
It creates a class "Game" which has methods to play the game, show the final score and also keeps track of number of times the user wins, the computer wins and the number of draws. It is constructed using python.
The game is played in a loop until the user types 'Q' to quit and then it shows the final score.
