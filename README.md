# Rock--Paper--Scissors

This is a simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors implemented in Python using the random module. The user can play the game by typing their choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors" in the terminal. The computer chooses a random option and the game calculates the winner based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

The game keeps track of the number of times the user wins, the computer wins, and the number of draws.
